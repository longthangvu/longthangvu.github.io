"I’m a 3rd-year Ph.D student in Computer Science and a machine learning researcher who enjoys both the theory and the engineering side of AI. \n

On the theory side, I’m interested in how models reason, why they can extract patterns, make predictions, and generalize across tasks. My current research on this side explores in-context learning for time-series forecasting, using ideas from Bayesian inference and Prior-Data Fitted Networks. \n

On the practical side, I love tinkering with systems and hardware. I like working close to the profiling, probing, debugging, and tuning models for on-device deployment. Lately, I’ve been focusing on making large models run efficiently on-device, especially as specialized NPUs and edge hardware become more common."
